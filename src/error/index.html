                In order for a VPN to work, it needs to make modifications to the system routing table. In essence, it needs to redirect traffic through the VPN as oppose to how it would normally be routed. This is not something that can be done without administrator privileges on most platforms. Whilst workarounds exist, we haven't found them to work consistently across all platforms. If you're worried about us doing anything malicious, you're free to inspect the source code and build the client yourself from the Github repository.
